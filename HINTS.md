1.
to bind to a class, use HostBinding

1.1.
To pass an input - use the directive's name (like we did in clickAndStop)

1.2.
to pass another input - need another attribute
to bind to a dynamic class, can't use HostBinding. Need ElementRef
If you've succeeded with ElementRef - read about Renderer


2.
just a regular pipe. Feel free to use open source libraries

2.1
hmm... sounds like an impure pipe to me....
If you set an interval - when do you unset it?
